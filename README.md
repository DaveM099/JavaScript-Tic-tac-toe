# JavaScript Tic tac toe
 My JavaScript Tic tact toe game was developed during the course, with many low to high-level enhancements such as a 4x4 grid, best of 3 play, timers, main menu screen, cosmetic enhancements, the option to change game icons by selecting a theme, different game difficulties, as well as an AI opponent option.  For more info visit the Word document report also attached in the Projects section, containing the game walkthrough, code, and functionality.
